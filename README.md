# ayufan's Rock64 Linux releases

This repository contains a set of scripts to build ROCK64 linux images.

This is community maintained project in my free time. Don't expect everything to be perfect and working. Rather be prepared that there are problems, as always try to fix them and contribute, but if you can't drop the issue here so we can track the progress and resolution of the problem.

## Releases

You can always download [latest stable](https://github.com/ayufan-rock64/linux-build/releases/latest) release. The **releases** are meant to be stable versions.

If you want to test bleeding edge features use one of the [pre-releases](https://github.com/ayufan-rock64/linux-build/releases).
Use pre-releases only if you want to test bleeding edge features.

## Compatibility

Not all releases support all features, some features get borked with some releases.
Follow this [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pCqJg0VSzvihUOoxCOq3wt5JeGB4iApAyBBfc_BGv2A)
to check the working features with each release.

## Issues

If you have any problems with this build or any of the features do not work, feel free to create a new issue in this repository.

Please include information about the version you are using, a list of connected peripherials and any other details (logs) that can be helpful to understand the root cause of your problems.

## Contributing

Feel free to edit any of the files and send a PR to this repository or any in this organization.
